            Posting an Ad
        </h3>
        <p>
            Online advertising gives us an opportunity to reach people as many as possible those who are interested in purchasing the goods that we post in a quick and effective way. But be careful while posting an ad as you may not know the people who respond to your ad.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Never include your personal information in the ad like your address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It’s always better not to post your picture and also don’t post adult material or nude images that oppose our terms and conditions.

                <li>
                    Talk to people on the phone and use your common sense before providing them information, like your address, and trust your instincts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If someone is coming to check out the items you advertised, make sure you're not alone when they arrive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It’s always good to show items that are portable but expensive like digital camera in public places instead of your home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take some one along with you when you meet the people personally.
